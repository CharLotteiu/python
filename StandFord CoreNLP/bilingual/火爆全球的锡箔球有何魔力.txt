Social-media users are turning tinfoil into superpolished, silver balls — they are obsessed.

　　社交媒体用户正痴迷于把锡箔打制成闪闪发亮的银球。

　　In March, YouTuber SKYtomo, who’s based in Japan and known for his DIY skills, uploaded a video of himself creating these shiny spheres and now has more than 2 million views and has inspired dozens of iterations on Instagram.

　　今年3月，以DIY技巧著称的日本youtube用户SKYtomo上传了一段自己制作这些闪亮球体的视频，现在已经有超过200万的点击量，并在Instagram上激发了数十次的迭代。


　　“This is sooooo satisfacting. This actually is a form of meditation. The focus and repetitive movements all create a deep calm and serenity for those inclined to do this. It’s the same for any creative art, painting, woodwork, sewing, etc.,” one YouTuber comments.

　　“这太令人满意了。这实际上是一种冥想形式。专注和重复的动作为那些想要做这件事的人创造了一种深沉的平静和宁静。任何创意艺术，绘画，木工，缝纫等都是这样的道理。”一名youtube用户评论道。

　　The process is inexpensive, but time-sucking: take a sheet of aluminum foil, scrunch it into a ball and hammer it down into a tightly packed orb. Then, spend hours polishing it into perfection until it looks like an oversized pinball.

　　这个过程成本很低，就是有点耗时:拿一张铝箔纸，把它揉成一个球，锤成一个紧实的球体。然后，花几个小时把它打磨完美，直到它看起来像一个超大的弹珠。
